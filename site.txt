host can be a hostname, IP address, or empty string. If an IP address is used, host should be an IPv4-formatted address string. The IP address 127.0.0.1 is the standard IPv4 address for the loopback interface, so only processes on the host will be able to connect to the server. If you pass an empty string, the server will accept connections on all available IPv4 interfaces.

port should be an integer from 1-65535 (0 is reserved). Itâ€™s the TCP port number to accept connections on from clients. Some systems may require superuser privileges if the port is < 1024.
